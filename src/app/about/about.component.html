        Hi!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m Alex! My family and I are from Baltimore, Maryland. My fiancé and I have two boys, and a lab pup! I love going to the beach, playing with my kids, and pizza!!!

        Before creating my own business, I was a dental assistant at a pediatric dental office. I loved being a dental assistant and bonding with my patients, however, with COVID we unfortunately had to shut our office down. Schools closed for just over a year. Everything was a disaster for us, as I’m sure it was for everyone at the beginning of this. Crafting was just a weekend hobby of mine. My fiancé and I decided that being able to stay home with the kids was more important during this crazy time so I decided to start my own small business and now we are here.

        My ultimate goal is to ensure my customers receive high quality and personable service and items. My family and I are so grateful for the support from our amazing customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We appreciate the out pouring of love and support that we receive!!

        I started this buisness as a way to help support my family, after I had recieved my degree to become a Dental Assistant I quickly found out that even with
        my recently aquired degree my sons day care was costing the same as I was making. I decided that time with my son is more important than barely affording to send him
        to day care, I become an at home mom and took my hobby of creating these unique tumblers and turned it into a buisness. Now I take care of home with my two boys and my Fiancé while
        running my own side buisness of creating custom and personlaized items for my wonderful customers!
